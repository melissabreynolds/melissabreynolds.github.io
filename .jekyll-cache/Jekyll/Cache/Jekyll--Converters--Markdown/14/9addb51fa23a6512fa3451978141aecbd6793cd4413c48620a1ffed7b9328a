<p>Taught as a seminar for the History Department at Princeton University, Spring 2020.</p>

<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>The ancient Greeks imagined a womanâ€™s body ruled by her uterus, while medieval 
Christians believed in a womb touched by God. Renaissance anatomists hoped to uncover the 
â€˜secretsâ€™ of human generation through dissection, while nascent European states wrote 
new laws to encourage procreation and manage â€˜illegitimateâ€™ offspring. From ancient Greece 
to enlightenment France, a womanâ€™s womb served as a site for the production of medical 
knowledge, the focus of religious practice, and the articulation of state power. In this 
course Students traced the evolution of medical and cultural theories about womenâ€™s 
reproductive bodies from ca. 450 BCE to 1700, linking these theories to the development 
of structures of power, notions of difference, and concepts of purity that proved 
foundational to â€˜westernâ€™ culture. Students read selections from Hippocratesâ€™ <em>Diseases 
of Women 1</em>, Galenâ€™s <em>On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body</em>, Augustineâ€™s <em>Confessions</em>, 
<em>The Trotula</em>, <em>Aristotleâ€™s Masterpiece</em>, and William Harveyâ€™s <em>Disputations
Touching the Generation of Animals</em>.</p>
