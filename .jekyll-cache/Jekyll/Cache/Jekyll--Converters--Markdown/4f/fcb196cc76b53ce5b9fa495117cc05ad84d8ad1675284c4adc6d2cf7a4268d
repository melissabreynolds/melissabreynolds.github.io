I",<p>I am the Perkins-Cotsen Postdoctoral Fellow in the Society of Fellows in
the Liberal Arts and a Lecturer in History at Princeton University. I received my Ph.D. 
in History from Rutgers University, and a BA and MA from the University of Alabama. I am 
a cultural historian of medieval and early modern Europe with broad research interests in the 
history of medicine and science, the history of gender and the body, and the history of 
material texts. In my research and teaching, I am particularly interested in 
tracing how elite or learned cultures of medical and scientific knowledge are conveyed 
to ‘ordinary’ people through non-elite media, and in turn, how access to this knowledge
brought about cultural change. I am currently at work on my first book, based on my
dissertation, titled <em>How To Make an Information Revolution: Reading Medicine and Science 
in England, 1400–1600</em>. I compare over 150 vernacular medieval ‘how-to’ manuscripts 
with over 250 printed ‘how-to’ books to demonstrate that engagement 
with popular medical and scientific books transformed how ordinary English people saw 
themselves as readers, writers, and consumers of knowledge. My research has been supported 
by the American Council of Learned Societies, the Richard III Society and the Medieval 
Academy of America, the Folger Shakespeare Library, and the Rare Books School at the 
University of Virginia.</p>
