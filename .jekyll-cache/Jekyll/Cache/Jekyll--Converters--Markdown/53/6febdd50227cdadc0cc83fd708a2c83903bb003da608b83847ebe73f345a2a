<p>The ancient Greeks imagined a woman‚Äôs body ruled by her uterus, while medieval 
Christians believed in a womb touched by God. Renaissance anatomists hoped to uncover the 
‚Äòsecrets‚Äô of human generation through dissection, while nascent European states wrote 
new laws to encourage procreation and manage ‚Äòillegitimate‚Äô offspring. <img src="/images/fertilebodies.png#right" alt="Women with opened uterus" width="175px" />
From ancient Greece to enlightenment France, a woman‚Äôs womb served as a site for the production of medical 
knowledge, the focus of religious practice, and the articulation of state power. 
In this course students traced the evolution of medical and cultural theories about women‚Äôs 
reproductive bodies from ca. 450 BCE to 1700, linking these theories to the development 
of structures of power, notions of difference, and concepts of purity that proved 
foundational to ‚Äòwestern‚Äô culture. Students read selections from Hippocrates‚Äô <em>Diseases 
of Women 1</em>, Galen‚Äôs <em>On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body</em>, Augustine‚Äôs <em>Confessions</em>, 
<em>The Trotula</em>, <em>Aristotle‚Äôs Masterpiece</em>, and William Harvey‚Äôs <em>Disputations
Touching the Generation of Animals</em>.</p>

<h3 id="a-history-of-words-technologies-of-communication-from-cuneiform-to-coding">A History of Words: Technologies of Communication from Cuneiform to Coding</h3>

<p>How do the methods, materials, and technologies of human communication shape religion, 
politics, popular culture, and the circulation of knowledge? Can we tie the invention of 
writing to the origins of cities? Would the ‚Äòreligions of the book‚Äô have flourished in 
the Middle Ages without the invention of the codex? Is it true that the printing press 
made the Reformation and the Scientific Revolution possible? And did newspapers really 
encourage the Age of Revolutions? Students tackled these questions as they traced the 
history of human communication from its origins in the ancient Near East to its diffusion 
over the World Wide Web. Weekly units zoomed in on ‚Äòrevolutions‚Äô within the history of 
communication to highlight how ‚Äònew‚Äô technologies of communication often spur broader 
cultural and societal change.</p>

<p>In addition to weekly thematic lectures and readings on the history of communication, 
students engaged with new digital methods of historical research and archival 
preservation. <img src="/images/cuneiform.jpg#left" alt="Cuneiform tablet" width="175px" />
Students learned how our latest revolution in communication‚Äìthe emergence 
of digital languages, interfaces, and platforms‚Äìhas transformed how historians and 
archivists preserve and interact with the material evidence of communication in the past. 
In weekly ‚Äúdigital labs,‚Äù students explored cutting-edge digital archives to analyze the 
influence of the digital on the work of history, while also trying their hands at the 
digital tools that are making new kinds of historical research possible.</p>
