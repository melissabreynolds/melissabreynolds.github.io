Hello! I am the Perking-Cotsen Postdoctoral Fellow in the Society of Fellows in
the Liberal Arts and a Lecturer in History at Princeton University. I am a cultural 
historian of medieval and early modern Europe with broad research interests in the 
history of material texts, the history of gender and the body, and the history of 
medicine and science. In my research and teaching, I am particularly interested in 
tracing how elite or learned cultures of knowledge are conveyed to ‘ordinary’ people 
through non-elite media, and in turn, how media circulation can bring about cultural 
change. These interests are reflected in her first book, “How To: Medicine, Science, and 
Renaissance Readers in an Information Revolution,” which compares over 150 vernacular 
medieval manuscripts with over 250 printed ‘how-to’ books to demonstrate that engagement 
with popular medical and scientific books transformed how ordinary English people saw 
themselves as readers, writers, and consumers of knowledge—a transformation that 
reverberated throughout society to impact nearly every aspect of English culture.

I received my Ph.D. in History from Rutgers University, and a BA and MA from the 
University of Alabama. My research has been supported by the American Council of 
Learned Societies, the Richard III Society and the Medieval Academy of America, the 
Folger Shakespeare Library, and the Rare Books School at the University of Virginia. 
On this site, you'll find my CV, links to my research, syllabi for courses I've taught, 
and the occasional discussion of research in progress.
