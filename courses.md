### Fertile Bodies: Reproduction from Antiquity to the Enlightenment

The ancient Greeks imagined a woman’s body ruled by her uterus, while medieval
Christians believed in a womb touched by God. Renaissance anatomists hoped to uncover the
‘secrets’ of human generation through dissection, while nascent European states wrote
new laws to encourage procreation and manage ‘illegitimate’ offspring. ![Women with opened uterus]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fertilebodies.png#right){: width="175px"}
From ancient Greece to enlightenment France, a woman’s womb served as a site for the production of medical
knowledge, the focus of religious practice, and the articulation of state power.
In this course students traced the evolution of medical and cultural theories about women’s
reproductive bodies from ca. 450 BCE to 1700, linking these theories to the development
of structures of power, notions of difference, and concepts of purity that proved
foundational to ‘western’ culture. Students read selections from Hippocrates' _Diseases
of Women 1_, Galen's _On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body_, Augustine's _Confessions_,
_The Trotula_, _Aristotle's Masterpiece_, and William Harvey's _Disputations
Touching the Generation of Animals_.

How do the methods, materials, and technologies of human communication shape religion,
politics, popular culture, and the circulation of knowledge? Can we tie the invention of
writing to the origins of cities? Would the ‘religions of the book’ have flourished in
the Middle Ages without the invention of the codex? Is it true that the printing press
made the Reformation and the Scientific Revolution possible? And did newspapers really
encourage the Age of Revolutions? Students tackled these questions as they traced the
history of human communication from its origins in the ancient Near East to its diffusion
over the World Wide Web. Weekly units zoomed in on ‘revolutions’ within the history of
communication to highlight how ‘new’ technologies of communication often spur broader
cultural and societal change.

In addition to weekly thematic lectures and readings on the history of communication,
students engaged with new digital methods of historical research and archival
preservation. Students learned how our latest revolution in communication--the emergence
of digital languages, interfaces, and platforms--has transformed how historians and
archivists preserve and interact with the material evidence of communication in the past.
In weekly “digital labs,” students explored cutting-edge digital archives to analyze the
influence of the digital on the work of history, while also trying their hands at the
digital tools that are making new kinds of historical research possible.
