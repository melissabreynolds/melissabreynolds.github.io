I am the Perkins-Cotsen Postdoctoral Fellow in the Society of Fellows in
the Liberal Arts and a Lecturer in History at Princeton University. I received my Ph.D.
in History from Rutgers University, and a BA and MA from the University of Alabama. ![Headshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/headshot.jpg){: width="200px" .right-image} I am
a cultural historian of medieval and early modern Europe with broad research interests in the
history of medicine and science, the history of gender and the body, and the history of
material texts. In my research and teaching, I am particularly interested in
tracing how elite or learned cultures of medical and scientific knowledge are conveyed
to ‘ordinary’ people through non-elite media, and in turn, how access to this knowledge
brought about cultural change. I am currently at work on my first book, based on my
dissertation, titled _How To: Reading Medicine and Science
in England, 1400–1600_. I compare over 150 vernacular medieval 'how-to' manuscripts
with over 250 printed ‘how-to’ books to demonstrate that engagement
with popular medical and scientific books transformed how ordinary English people understood the possibilities of knowledge itself.

I've published scholarly articles in the _Journal of British Studies_ and in _Social History of Medicine_. I've also written
about a little known [early modern epidemic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/03/18/communication-failures-pandemic-can-be-catastrophic/)
and about lessons to be learned from [pre-modern reproductive medicine](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/05/09/key-lowering-americas-high-rates-maternal-mortality/) in the _Washington Post_.
I am a longtime contributor and editorial team member for the scholarly blog, The Recipes Project,
where I've written on [perpetual prognostications,](https://recipes.hypotheses.org/17522)
[reproductive medical recipes,](https://recipes.hypotheses.org/15134) and [playful magic](https://recipes.hypotheses.org/14220) in medieval recipe books.
My research has been supported by the American Council of Learned Societies, the Richard III Society and the Medieval
Academy of America, the Folger Shakespeare Library, and the Rare Books School at the
University of Virginia.
